# Vanilla JS To-Do List

Simple To-Do app (front-end only) using **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**.  
Features: add tasks, toggle complete, delete, clear completed, live counters, and localStorage persistence.

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` with a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
- No backend required.

## Folder
- `index.html` — structure
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — logic (DOM events + localStorage)

## Notes
- Uses event delegation for list actions.
- Prevents default form submission to avoid reloads.
- Updates UI instantly and persistently.
